# AWSbatcher
Large scale open data processing.

##### About
As neuro-imaging data is becoming increasingly available, there is greater need for data preprocessing. This repository pre-processes (with [fmriprep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep)) open datasets (obtained through [DataLad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad)) leveraging [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/).

#### Requirements
- AWS credentials
- IAM role with EC2 + S3 permissions
- Custom AMI with increased docker base device size

#### Usage
TODO (WIP)
